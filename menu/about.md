title: About Me

Hi there, I'm a data scientist living in cologne.

After my degree in mathematics and computer science I've discovered my passion for python and data. That with my statistical and Linux background formed my stepping stone for my profession.

Since 2017 I'm working as a data scientist in several companies and industries. Some  of my projects are:

- Recommender systems for commercial fares
- Automated model builder for car insurance
- Building and maintaining of various data pipelines and dashboards
- Feature extraction from real estate images
- News feed summarizer

and more.

I've realized these projects in python with jupyter notebooks and PyCharm.
Besides these coding heavy parts of these projects there have been Postgres, Mongodb, Superset, Splunk, Kafka, Docker, Vagrant, Ansible and Jenkins involved.
